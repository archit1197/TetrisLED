# TetrisLED

A simple Python script that emulates the classic video-game "Tetris" in the form of a matrix(2-D vector) of 1s and 0s.
Can be modified to a PyGame having a cool GUI.

This code was made as a part of a project, coupled with an LED Array and run through a RasberryPi. so that the user will be able to play the game on a portable handset.
